<sub>Day and night mean nothing here. I don't know how long I've been here, but now... I feel calm. So very calm. It's so very still. There's nothing more to hinder you here. I hear no footsteps. No voices. I feel nothing.</sub>

<sub>I don't remember how I got here. I don't know how to leave. But I don't really want to. I just hope this lasts a little longer...</sub>

<sub>I wonder what it all meant. Why was I allowed in? Will someone come for me? I wish I could meet them again.</sub>

<sub>But that can wait... I'm... **tired**. I'll just rest a while.</sub>
